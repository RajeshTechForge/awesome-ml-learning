This repository contains **Practical Notes** for every chapter of the book "**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**" by Aurélien Géron. The notes contain code snippets along with proper comments and most importantly, **Points & Decision Logics** that one must remember while working on a new dataset.


## Why this Repository?

While I was learning ML from the book "**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**" by Aurélien Géron, I found myself to go back and forth to the book, every time when I stuck while practicing the concepts, __on a complete new dataset__ from Kaggle. Therefore, I decided to create a **Practical Notes** for every chapter of the book, so that I can refer to it whenever I need to.

But my motive was not create a blind cheat-sheet, which only contains code snippets. Instead, I wanted to create a note that contain code-snippets along with proper comments(for shotest explanation) and most importantly, **Points & Decision Logics** that I must remember while working on a dataset.


## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> I prefer to use Google Colab (free one is enough for practicing ML concepts). But if you want to run the code locally, follow the steps below.

1. Create a folder and use python virtual environment
   ```bash
   mkdir ml-learning && cd ml-learning

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

   ```

2. Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # given in this repository

   ```


## One more thing...

I created this reposetory for my personal benifit while I was learning ML from the book. But I thought it might be useful for others as well, so I am sharing it here.
